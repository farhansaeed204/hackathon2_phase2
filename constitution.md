# HK2 Phase II Constitution

## Purpose
This document establishes the foundational principles and guidelines for the Hackathon Phase II project.

## Core Values
1. **Agility**: Rapid iteration and deployment
2. **Security**: Secure authentication and data handling
3. **Scalability**: Designed for growth and performance
4. **Maintainability**: Clean, documented code

## Technical Standards
- Backend: FastAPI with SQLModel and NeonDB
- Frontend: Next.js 14 with TypeScript
- Authentication: JWT with Better Auth
- Deployment: Vercel for frontend, Docker for backend

## Architecture Principles
- API-first design with RESTful endpoints
- Component-based frontend architecture
- Separation of concerns in backend services
- Environment-based configuration

## Quality Assurance
- All code must pass linting and type checking
- Unit tests for critical business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Security scanning for dependencies
